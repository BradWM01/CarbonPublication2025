abstract = {Graphite, an attractive moderating material due to its unique characteristics, has been used in different reactor generations and is currently a candidate for future Generation IV high-temperature reactors and molten salt-cooled reactors. The graphite material is complex and its properties are dependent on the length scale. Furthermore, the bulk graphite properties are dependent on many factors, such as manufacturing, grain size, and operational environment. These properties also change over time due to irradiation. Based on experience gained from different current graphite moderated reactors, referring to both past experience and data more recently obtained in various EU Framework projects, this chapter introduces the basics of graphite as a nuclear material for application to Generation IV reactors. Current procedures and understanding of graphite manufacturing, material properties models, component structural integrity assessment, and waste management are presented to help future reactor designers. Specific issues related to high-temperature nuclear graphite are also discussed.}

In general, oxidation proceeds faster if open porosity is more uniformly distributed and can incrementally access closed pore surface area with more ease.}

abstract = {Understanding “Where?” and “How much?” oxidation has occurred in a nuclear graphite component is critical to predicting any deleterious effects to physical, mechanical, and thermal properties. A key factor in answering these questions is characterizing the effective mass transport rates of gas species in nuclear graphites. Effective gas diffusion coefficients were determined for twenty-six graphite specimens spanning six modern grades of nuclear graphite. A correlation was established for the majority of grades examined allowing a reasonable estimate of the effective diffusion coefficient to be determined purely from an estimate of total porosity. The importance of Knudsen diffusion to the measured diffusion coefficients is also shown for modern grades. Knudsen diffusion has not historically been considered to contribute to measured diffusion coefficients of nuclear graphite.}

abstract = {The oxidized residual strength for two nuclear graphite grades, fine-grained IG-110 and medium-grained NBG-18, were determined over a mass loss range of 0% to 10% for three different oxidation temperatures. This study addresses the critical licensing issue of determining oxidized strength of graphite core components within the design rules of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler Pressure and Vessel Code over a range of oxidation temperatures from 550 °C to 750°C. Results generally demonstrate low-temperature oxidation to have a 30% greater strength reduction than similar mass losses at higher oxidation temperatures. These differences are attributed to whether the graphite oxidizes primarily within the kinetic-controlled regime or the diffusion-controlled regime which dictate the level of oxidation penetration depth into the interior microstructure. Finally, this study presents a new test method for determining mechanical compression strength from previously oxidized graphite material. This test procedure is based upon two approved American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards, ASTM D7542 and C695, and combines the requirements for both standards. It is hoped that this new test method can assist ASME BPVC users in determining oxidized residual strength since there are currently no approved standard for conducting such tests.}

abstract = {Beginning with Chicago Pile I, graphite has been used as a moderator material in nuclear power stations and is considered a potential material for use in future Generation IV advanced reactors. The microstructure of graphite is responsible for much of its mechanical and thermo-physical properties, and how it responds to irradiation. To understand graphite microstructure, it is necessary to understand its porosity at the macro- and micro-scales; and to understand its porosity, it is necessary to characterize the morphological connectivity of the void content and the two main phases of graphite: filler and binder. Here, using several microscopy and analytical techniques, a detailed examination of the heterogeneity, microstructure and pore structure of different graphite grades and their binder and filler phases is presented. Significant differences were found between coarser and finer nuclear grades. Coarse grades have a more diverse range of filler particles, pores and thermal cracks. Finer grades have a more well-defined pore size distribution, fewer variations of filler particles sizes and do not contain as many large thermal cracks. Fine grades tend to have a well-connected network of pores whereas coarser grades contain a larger content of closed porosity. The framework developed within this work can be applied and used to assess the various graphite grades that would down-select materials for specific use in graphite moderated reactor designs.}

Irradiation and radiolytic oxidation change the pore volume of nuclear graphite and the relative ratios of open (coolant gas accessible) and closed pore volume. Particular focus has been paid to the deformation of the Gilsocarbon graphite observed during mercury intrusion at high pressure, which has previously marred the use of porosimetry to characterise this material. The results show clear trends in the evolution of the Gilsocarbon graphite porous space. Semi-quantitative deductions are made that will assist the modelling of the evolution of the pore space in the context of the safe extension of the reactors’ working lifetimes.}

abstract = {Microstructural changes induced by neutron irradiation of superfine grain graphite G347A (Tokai Carbon, Japan) were examined by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K and by three microscopy techniques (SEM, TEM and FIB-SEM tomography). The specimens were irradiated at doses of up to 30 dpa, covering stages before and after the turnaround fluence at three temperatures (300, 450, 750 °C) of their irradiation envelope. The initial graphite densification at low fluences did not produce any detectable effect in the pore size range (<350 nm) measured by gas adsorption. However, graphite irradiated at high fluences, after turnaround, showed severe structural changes. At all three temperatures and high irradiation fluences, gas adsorption revealed significant increase of the volume of narrow mesopores (<5–20 nm) and up to five times increase of BET surface area, both in linear relationship with the relative volume expansion. Analysis of microscopy images showed multiplication of fine macropores (>50 nm) at high irradiation fluences and more structural changes on multiple scales, from nanometers to microns. This work demonstrates the unique ability of gas adsorption techniques to analyze open pores with sizes between sub-nanometer and sub-micron in bulk nuclear graphite, with supporting microscopy results.}
